            <p>Mindful meditation is a contemplative practice that, over time, can build resilience and coping skills to support you to gain perspective, navigate the demands of daily life, and build compassion. Weekly guided sits offer a virtual community of practice that explores present-moment awareness, open and directed attention, non-judgment, and self-compassion. CEW+ Inspire Midweek Mindfulness welcomes practitioners of all skill levels. Each session offers instruction, support, and the opportunity to practice guided and self-directed mindful meditation. Participate weekly, or drop in as your schedule allows. All are welcome!</p>
